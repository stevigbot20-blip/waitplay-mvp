**Subject:** Quick $99 sponsor test for Tally?

Hi Tally Team,

I run WaitPlay, a simple widget that helps sites keep visitors engaged while pages load.

I'm opening 5 pilot sponsor slots this month: **$99 flat for 30 days**.
You get: placement in the widget, weekly stats, and a short wrap-up report.

I thought of Tally because your no-code form audience overlaps with indie makers launching products repeatedly.

Worth a quick yes/no? If yes, I'll send the 1-page pilot details.

## 2. Senja (Variant B - Email)

**Subject:** Low-risk sponsor slot: $99 / 30 days

Hey Senja Team,

I'm testing a lightweight sponsorship channel via WaitPlay (on-site engagement widget).

Offer is simple:
- 30-day sponsor placement
- $99 total
- Click + CTR tracking
- Fast start (24–48h)

I'm keeping pilots small so each sponsor gets attention. Think Senja could be a fit?

If interested, reply "details" and I'll send the one-pager.

## 3. Typefully (Variant C - Email)

**Subject:** Tiny experiment with Typefully?

Hi Typefully Team,

Random but relevant: I'm a solo founder running WaitPlay, and I'm offering a **$99 pilot sponsor slot** for brands that want a small, measurable test.

No long contract. Just 30 days, clear metrics, and a recap.

Open to seeing the 1-page outline?

Thanks,
Steve

Quick one: would Tweet Hunter try a tiny sponsor experiment? $99 flat, 30-day placement in my WaitPlay widget, measurable results. Can send 1-page brief.

## 6. Carrd (Variant C - X DM)

Built a small engagement widget (WaitPlay) and opening low-lift sponsor pilots. If useful for Carrd, I can set up a $99/30-day slot this week. Interested?

## 7. Lemon Squeezy (Variant A - Reddit DM)

## 8. Podpage (Variant B - Reddit DM)

Not selling hard — just sharing a tiny ad test: WaitPlay has 30-day sponsor slots at $99 while I validate demand. Could be useful for Podpage if you want measurable traffic without long commitment.

## 10. Beehiiv (Variant A - Email)

**Subject:** Quick $99 sponsor test for Beehiiv?

Hi Beehiiv Team,

I run WaitPlay, a simple widget that helps sites keep visitors engaged while pages load.

I'm opening 5 pilot sponsor slots this month: **$99 flat for 30 days**.
You get: placement in the widget, weekly stats, and a short wrap-up report.

I thought of Beehiiv because your newsletter operators need low-friction sponsor channels; pilot can be positioned as additive.

Worth a quick yes/no? If yes, I'll send the 1-page pilot details.
