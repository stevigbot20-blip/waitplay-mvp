### Variant A — Direct Pilot Ask
**Subject:** Quick $99 sponsor test for {brand}?

Hi {name},

I run WaitPlay, a simple widget that helps sites keep visitors engaged while pages load.

I’m opening 5 pilot sponsor slots this month: **$99 flat for 30 days**.
You get: placement in the widget, weekly stats, and a short wrap-up report.

I thought of {brand} because {audience_fit}.

Worth a quick yes/no? If yes, I’ll send the 1-page pilot details.

### Variant B — Value + Social Proof Lite
**Subject:** Low-risk sponsor slot: $99 / 30 days

Hey {name},

I’m testing a lightweight sponsorship channel via WaitPlay (on-site engagement widget).

Offer is simple:
- 30-day sponsor placement
- $99 total
- Click + CTR tracking
- Fast start (24–48h)

I’m keeping pilots small so each sponsor gets attention. Think {brand} could be a fit?

If interested, reply “details” and I’ll send the one-pager.

### Variant C — Soft Intro
**Subject:** Tiny experiment with {brand}?

Hi {name},

Random but relevant: I’m a solo founder running WaitPlay, and I’m offering a **$99 pilot sponsor slot** for brands that want a small, measurable test.

No long contract. Just 30 days, clear metrics, and a recap.

Open to seeing the 1-page outline?

Thanks,
{your_name}
