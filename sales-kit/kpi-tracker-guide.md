# 30-Day KPI Guide (Sales Execution)

## Daily Minimum Targets
- Add prospects: **10**
- Send outreach: **20**
- Follow-ups: **10**
- Book calls: **1+ per day average**

## Weekly Targets
- Replies: 10–20%
- Positive replies: 3–8%
- Pilots closed: 1–3/week
- Revenue target: **$396+ / month** (4 pilots)

## How to Use the CSV
1. Update one row per day.
2. Fill outreach + response metrics first.
3. Add performance metrics (impressions/clicks/CTR) once sponsors are live.
4. In Notes, record what changed (new template, audience, channel).

## Simple Weekly Review (15 min)
- Which channel had best reply rate? (Email/X/Reddit)
- Which message variant got best positive replies?
- Where are leads dropping off? (No reply, no call, no close)
- What one change will you test next week?

## Decision Rules
- If reply rate <5% for 5 days: rewrite opener + tighten targeting.
- If positive replies but no closes: improve one-pager clarity + CTA.
- If clicks are good but CTR low: test sponsor copy/placement.
